<!-- Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-ASP
About:
I decided to make ASP (Action Server Pages, or Classic ASP) the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ASP) as ASP is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the ASP programming language. It only makes sense to ASP the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
